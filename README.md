## 🚀 About Me

I'm Kshitij Nevrekar — a Data Scientist in training, and someone who can probably debug a Python script faster than I can find my keys.

When I’m not taming dataframes or wrestling with neural nets, I’m min-maxing my builds in survival games or trying to automate something for the fun of it.

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, R, Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- **ML/DS Stuff**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Deep Learning, EDA, Time Series  
- **Deployment & Tools**: Docker, GitHub, Streamlit, Jupyter, AWS, Gemini API  
- **Data Viz**: Power BI, Tableau, Excel, Matplotlib  
- **Special Powers**: Feature engineering, web scraping, cloud computing, and always asking “but why though?”

## 🧪 Projects I'm Proud Of

### 🐦 Avian Intelligence 50  
CNN-powered bird recognition + fun facts chatbot + Hugging Face deployment = birdwatchers' dream  
→ [Hugging Face Space (Live Soon!)](https://huggingface.co/aevnum)

### 👀 Attention Aware Video Player  
Your YouTube takes a pause when you stop looking? Yeah, I made that happen.

### 🕺 HealthyDance VR  
Like JustDance… but with Unity, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and way more squats while debugging.

### 🖱️ Hackathon Registration Portal  
Simple, secure, and actually works without breaking at 3AM
